# CSE Search Engine Project 
Project helped us build a mini version of Google's Search Engine
- Implemented jUnit tests for ArrayHeap and Searcher.topKSort() classes/methods
- Implmented an ArrayHeap class
- Implemented the Searcher.topKSort() method that returns the top k elements from a list of n elements
- Search engine would perform searches via a downloaded file of websites and their contents
- Implemented code for a Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency ranking class that measures how important a given word is to a particular document
- Implemented a relevance computer that determined how relevant an algorithm is to a query
- Built a web graph that represented the internet where each webpage was a vertex and each link was an edge. This graph was represented through using an adjacency list
- Implemented a PageRank method which precomputes the page rank for every webpage in the graph
